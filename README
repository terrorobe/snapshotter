       snapshotter - A LVM-based filesystem tree snapshot creator


What is this?
=============

snapshotter is a tool which helps you to automatically create a snapshot
of your complete "virtual" filesystem tree which you then can use as source
for a consistent backup.

Example
=======

Mountpoints:

/ -> /dev/mapper/vg-root
/boot -> /dev/hda2
/srv -> /dev/mapper/vg-srv

snapshotter being called in "snapshot" mode with /mnt/backup as path would
do the following actions:

*) Create the directory for the mountpoint /mnt/backup
*) Create snapshots of the "root" and "srv" logical volumes
*) Mount the snapshots in /mnt/backup and /mnt/backup/srv respectively
*) Bind-Mount /boot to /mnt/backup/boot

You can then use /mnt/backup to save a consistent state of the filesystems.

When you call snapshotter in "teardown" mode, it does the above actions in
reverse order.
